#01/24/2012:
* Changed configs : set no sdcard and disabled screen-off animation (causes issues w/ certain kernels, easier to leave disabled and let people enable at their own risk depending on kernel).
* Created CWM branch and added recovery option back into reboot for this branch (CWM recovery by the DoomLord sets bootmode properly so no recovery loop issues).
